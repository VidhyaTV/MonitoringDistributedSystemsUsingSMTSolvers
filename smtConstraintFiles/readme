This folder contains all SMT constraint files (for the solver) generated during execution of the distributed system.
These SMT files were generated to analyze the effect of various system properties like (inter-process communication frequency, message delay, local predicate rate, etc) on Monitoring time (Z3 time to solve the problem).
